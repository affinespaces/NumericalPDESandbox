# Numerical PDE Sandbox

This is a sandbox for playing with concepts in numerical solution of partial differential equations as I work through Finite Difference Methods for Ordinary and Partial Differential Equations by Randall J. LeVeque.

For usage examples see the `main.py` script, which can be run interactively with `python -i main.py`.

Unit tests can be run with pytest by doing `python -m pytest solver` (after doing `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
